Assignments:

1. CSS Styling:

    Style the header to have a background color of your choice and center the title.
    Add hover effects to the links in the navigation.

2. JavaScript Functions:

    Write a function that displays an alert when the page is loaded saying "Welcome to the Web App Practice Page!"

3. Event Handling:

    Add a button below each article titled "Read More". When clicked, display an alert saying "This is a preview of [Article Name]".

5. Traversing the DOM:

    Add a button at the bottom of the page that, when clicked, counts and displays the number of <article> tags present.

4. Manipulating the DOM with Classes:

    Add a button that toggles a .dark-mode class on the <body> element. Create the corresponding CSS for .dark-mode that changes the background to a dark color and text to a light color.

6. Manipulating the DOM with IDs:

    Assign unique IDs to both articles. Write a JavaScript function that takes an article ID as a parameter and changes its background color.

7. More on Event Handling:

    Modify the nav links so that, when clicked, they prevent the default action and instead display an alert with the name of the link clicked.

8. DOM Creation:

    Add a button that, when clicked, creates a new <article> with a title "Article 3" and some sample content. Append this to the section containing the articles.

9. Form Handling:

    Add a simple form with an input and a submit button. When the form is submitted, prevent the default action and instead display an alert showing the value entered in the input.

10. Advanced DOM Manipulation:

    Add a "Delete" button next to each article. When clicked, it should remove the corresponding article from the page.

With these assignments, you should get a good understanding of the basics of web application development and the power of JavaScript in manipulating the DOM. They'll also get to practice styling with CSS and see the immediate effects of their changes.
